Hi Thierry, thanks for the offer of contributions, be careful what you wish for! :-)

There is a lot of focus on cost reduction/control within the industry, particularly for North Sea operations. The wood review also emphaised greater collaboration is needed. In geospatial, it seems clear that adopting common established standards and organising data more efficiently is a sensible thing to do.

Two points for discussion that spring to mind on this theme:

1. How do we encourage further uptake of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant standards within geospatial Petroleum community. The SeabedML (GML) implemenation of SSDM is a great, positive step in the right direction. However, I feel there is still a severe lack of understanding and appreciation of the value that open OGC standards bring within our community. I have had a couple of recent examples that have highlighted the lack of 'perceived demand' for OGC formats.

2. To improve collaboration, as a community, we need to think what data can be shared without compromising confidentiality. Releasing CDA (formerly DEAL) spatial data for free reuse into the public domain would be an encouraging step. Also, making the submission of INSPIRE-compliant metadata mandatory as part of survey application to DECC or maybe releasing the metadata on completion of the survey again would encourage reuse.

Food for thought.
